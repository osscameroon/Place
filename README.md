# Place

## Introduction

Place is an open-source platform for managing tickets and events, developed using the Dotnet framework. It allows event organizers to sell tickets and oversee attendees without incurring service fees from third-party ticketing providers.

Using Place, you can explore popular events nearby, receive tailored event suggestions, and see what events your friends are attending.
You can also access your tickets and event details directly from your phone, tablet or pc.
Discover new activities through your phone, from concerts and festivals to workshops, conferences, free events, and more.

Event organizers have the ability to monitor sales, view analytics, and handle attendee check-ins right from the app.
Place provides a complete solution for event management and promotion, helping users stay informed and connected.
